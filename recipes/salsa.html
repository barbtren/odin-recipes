        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Spicy, fresh and tasty fire-roasted salsa! Easy to make at home and a great addition to a movie night, potluck, or beach day.</p>
        <p>As a lover of fresh salsa, I quickly got sick and tired of paying 6.99 for a small container at the grocery store, and I went on the hunt for the best and most flavourful recipe that I could come back to over and over again. This is it! This recipe has never let me down. It is flexible, easy to modify with whatever ingredients you have on hand, and way tastier than anything from the grocery store.</p>
