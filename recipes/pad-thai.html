        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pad Thai is one of my all time favourite quick weeknight dinners. Flavourful, nutritious and only requiring a handful of ingredients - what more could you ask for!</p>
        <p>While many Pad Thai recipes call for tomato paste, ketchup, and other ingredients to add in tangy flavour and orange colour, this recipe uses the traditionally correct ingredient of tamarind paste. Tamarind can be challenging to find at times in Canadian grocery stores, so I always try to keep a stockpile of tamarind paste in the freezer. This is a vegetarian recipe, so the fish sauce that would be traditionally used has been substituted with shitaake powder and soy sauce. I have found this combination to add a great umami flavour to the finished dish!</p>
